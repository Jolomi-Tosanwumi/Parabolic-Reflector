Parabolic reflectors are common in our modern world. From satelite dishes to refloctors in torches, their use cannot be overemphasied. They are mainly used to perfectly focus parallel rays (whether light or radio wave) to a point. They can also be used to beam parallel rays of light from a source placed in the reflector's focus.

In this repository, I used Python to show that parabolic reflectors would indeed converge parallel rays of light to its focus.

...it is good to catch fun with coding on holidays :)
